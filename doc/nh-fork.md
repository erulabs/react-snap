# Why we forked this repo

First of all we would like to thank @stereobooster for the amazing work he has done on this library, it works very well and saved us a lot of trouble in our projects! It is also definitely the best solution around for SPA's pre-rendering, which is why we wanted to keep using it.

We have forked this repository because we want to use it on some of our projects and thought that it could really benefit from having some new functionality, fixes and documentation added in order to solve some of the problems we had.

The branch `original` holds the latest `master' version of the original repository. All of the changes we make from this point forward are carefully documented and registered, so it can even be merged back to the original repository at some point if needed.

We would love for everyone that contributed to the original repo to come forward and work with us on this fork, and of course share this version of the package if wanted.
